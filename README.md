To Monitor the parental Health

In todays busy world people tend to forget things, which should be taken care. 
On of them is day-to-day medicine dosage.  The situation gets worse, when individual is advised to take multiple medicines at 
different time slots of the day. Also it is difficult to track the status of the medicine consumption over a period of time. 
This may affect the individualâ€™s health in long run.
 
 To address this issue we have develop an android application, which will help the people to keep track of their medicine 
 consumption on daily basis.Our application will accept medicine details as input from the user in order to schedule the reminder. 
 Our app will notify the user at scheduled time with the vibration and Audio message. Once the user acknowledges the notification 
 the status of the medicine consumed is updated in the application repository, which may also be used for future references.
 
 Application wise it perfoms CURD operation for medicines details, stores in the repository for notification and future tracking.
 UI is simple as of now.
